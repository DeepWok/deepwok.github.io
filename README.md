## Student Projects

Each year, we run and supervise a number of students for their undergraduate and master projects at Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge. We also run a great number of summer research internships.

### Project proposals

This is an incomplete list of possible projects for summer/PartII/PartIII/Mphil/MSc/FYP students:

* [Wide Vision Transformers](https://www.notion.so/Wide-Vision-Transformers-eb3d0d5a072144ec9538112a25ad31b3)
* [Transformer Quantization Framework](https://www.notion.so/Transformer-Quantization-Framework-cb3530272681413fa403d07064b03c32)
